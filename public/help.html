                    <p><h6>This page briefly decribes how to use the visualization tool. Looking at the screenshot below, there are four page areas:<br />
                        <ul>
                            <li>Starting with the main 3D viewing area, situated right in the middle of the page, the visualization starts by 
                                showing the gaits of six participants, selected from a larger dataset of participants. Users can interact with the
                                scene by rotating it, panning and zooming in/out.</li>
                            <li>At both the left and right sides of the main 3D viewing area you can see the side view collapsing buttons, as 
                                <span style="color:orange">highlighted</span> in the screenshot below. They allow the user to expand the 3D viewing
                                area as well as resetting it back to the original view.</li>
                            <li>The left side the page contains the filtering tools, as <span style="color: yellow">highlighted</span> in the 
                                screenshot below. They allow controlling the participants subset viewed by selecting the trial, the speed and a different 
                                set of participants. Filtering can also be done by gender, age, height and weight. The filtering tools will update the 
                                distribution plots located both at the bottom left and right sides of the page.</li>
                            <li>The the collaboration tools on the top navigation bar, as <span style="color: red">highlighted</span> in the 
                                screenshot below, contains a Collaboration button that allows creating of a url that can be then shared with another user
                                which will be able to see the shared screen. The Save/Export button will allow saving of the main 3D viewing area as an
                                image, as well as saving of the current participant dataset in CSV/JSON formats. Finally, the Upload button can be used
                                to import participant datasets from outside.</li>
                        </ul></h6>
                    </p>
                    <p><h6>There is also a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aFf-yrP6EA" style="color: #00adb5" target="_blank">3-min video</a> 
                        going over the features described on this page. Hopefully, you will find the tool interesting and useful!</h6></p>
